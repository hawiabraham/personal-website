      <h2 class="title">Hey, I’m Hawi, nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I’m a sophomore at Stanford University studying Symbolic Systems and I enjoy building products.
      </p>

      <p>My interest in computer science started back in 2018 when I first learned of the P vs. NP problem. Since then, I've learned over five programming languages and my passion for problem solving has only grown stronger.

        Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at a 
        <a href="https://hingehealth.com">a startup</a>, 
        <a href="https://jacktrip.com">a music company</a>, and a 
        <a href="https://blackincs.stanford.edu/black-lair">student-led tutoring lab</a>. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at 
        <a href="https://hingehealth.com">Hinge Health</a> for a variety of clients.
        </p>
      <p>I’d love to learn about your company and see how I can help, feel free to send me an email!</p>
