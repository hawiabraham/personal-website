I currently collaborate on a marine biology underwater recording project creating a music sample pack with over 100 marine life sounds. I spearheaded an archive of the project by building a website using HTML and CSS and created a project roadmap for the research project, delegate tasks, and assess capacity. You can keep up with our research project at this website, programmed by me.
